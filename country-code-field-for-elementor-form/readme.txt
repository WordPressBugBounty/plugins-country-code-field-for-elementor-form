### Free Plugin Features:

* **Seamless Integration with Elementor Forms**: This ultimate Elementor addon helps users enter valid mobile numbers by selecting the correct country dial code before typing their phone number. It ensures properly formatted data, improves form validation, and reduces errors in contact forms, booking forms, registration forms, and more. 

* **Show Only Selected Countries**: Limit the dropdown to display only specific countries. For example, if you only want to show Canada, India, United States, and United Kingdom, simply enter their **[alpha-2 codes](https://www.iban.com/country-codes)** in the Tel field settings like: `ca,in,us,gb`.  

* **Exclude Specific Countries**: Show all countries but hide a few by entering their alpha-2 codes (e.g., `af,pk` removes Afghanistan and Pakistan).

* **Set a Default Country**: Preselect a default country code when the form loads.

* **Control Dial Code Visibility**: Show or hide the dial code while users type their phone number.

* **Strict Mode Validation**: Enable strict mode to block invalid numbers or extra digits based on the selected country.

* **Compatibility with Hello Plus**: This addon also works with the Hello Plus form lite widget. If you are creating forms using Elementor Free with Hello Plus, you can still add an international dial code dropdown to the phone field using this ultimate addon.

### Upgrade for More Features

   Automatically select the user’s country code in the phone field based on their IP address. You can enable this feature inside your Elementor form by using CoolFormKit pro version.

* **Show or Hide Country Flags**  
   Choose whether to display country flags alongside dial codes. For faster form loading, you can disable flags and only show the country dial codes.

* **[Country & State Field for Elementor Form](https://coolformkit.com/features/country-and-state-field-for-elementor-form/?utm_source=ccfef_plugin&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=features&utm_content=pro_features)**
